description: Join us for our GWU's Strategic Crisis Simulation's annual United States vs. China simulation with a green team twist! This year's Rising Tides will focus on the South China Sea and the implications of contested oil rights between China and the Philippines. When a Philippine National Oil Company ship is seized by what appears to be Chinese fishermen, tensions run high in the region with potentially disastrous consequences.
